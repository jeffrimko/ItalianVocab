= Italian Vocab

== Introduction
This repository is a collection of Italian vocabulary words and phrases. Simple scripts are provided to help review and learn the vocab.

== Requirements
To use the provided scripts, Python 2.7/3.x is required. The following third party libraries are also required and can be installed using `pip`: auxly, qprompt.

== Usage
To use the scripts, simply execute them with a Python 2.7/3.x interpreter.

To update or add new vocab words, follow these conventions:

  - Vocab files use the `.txt` extension.
  - Each line is a single vocab entry.
  - Vocab entry lines use the format: `<english>;<italian>`
      * Example: `hello;ciao`
  - Synonyms are separated with a `/`.
      * Example: `goodbye;addio/ciao`
  - Append additional info in parenthesis.
      * Example: `hello;buongiorno (formal)`
